GasEquilibrium is an algorithm that simulates the movement of gas particles in two sectors, A and B, and calculates the number of particles in each sector at different instants. The algorithm uses a random number generator to determine the direction of each particle at each instant, and changes the sector of the particle if the direction is 1. The algorithm also writes the results to a text file, with the format “Instant\tSectorA\tSectorB”.

The algorithm is written in C#, an object-oriented and cross-platform programming language. To run the algorithm, you need to have the .NET Framework1 or the .NET Core2 installed on your system. Moreover, you need to have an IDE or a text editor that supports the C# language, such as Visual Studio3, Visual Studio Code or MonoDevelop.

To use the algorithm, follow these steps:

- Clone or download the GitHub repository of the project.
- Open the file Program.cs with your IDE or text editor.
- Compile and run the code.
- The algorithm will create a text file named Gas.txt in the same folder as the Program.cs file.
- Open the Gas.txt file with a text editor or a spreadsheet program to see the results of the simulation.

The algorithm is distributed under the MIT license, which allows the use, modification and distribution of the code to anyone, as long as the same license is maintained and the authorship of the original author is recognized. The algorithm is based on the concept of gas equilibrium, which is a topic in physics, chemistry, and thermodynamics.
